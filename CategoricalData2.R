# Introduction \label{sec1}

The aim of this project is to build a customer churn model for a telecommunication company to predict the customers who are about to get churned so that they can implement different business strategies to retain those customers before they actually get churned. The tool that I am using for this analysis is R-studio. This project was be conducted in 2 different phase where I went through exploring different data analysis techniques to accurately predict the churned customers. Phase 1 of this project will included the detailed descriptive statistical analysis of the data by making use of various R packages to build relevant charts, graphs, and interactions etc. Data preprocessing was be done to clean and transform the data to suit the prediction model.

In this second phase of this project we are building the  model after checking  appropriate statistical procedures, the test of independence etc. The relevence and independence of different variables are explored using confidence intervals and hypothesis analysis. The dataset was completely analysed for different assumptions made for the purpose of this project.

# Dataset source and description

The following packages are used in this report for data preparation and data modeling.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(package = binom)
library(caret)
library(MASS)
library(car)
```

The data was read into a data file named 'telcom_churn'. Null values are replaced with 'NA' while reading the file.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/amaljoy/Study/Categorcal Data/Assignment 2/")
telcom_churn <- read.csv(
  "/Users/amaljoy/Study/Categorcal Data/Assignment 2/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv", 
  header=T,na.strings=c("","NA")) # Reading the data

dim(telcom_churn) # dimensions of the dataset
```

The dataset consists of 21 variables and 7043 observations. Each row in the dataset is the attributes associated to a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes. The customer attributes are provided below:
  * customerID (Unique customer identification)  
* gender (female, male)  
* SeniorCitizen (Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0))  
* Partner (Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No))  
* Dependents (Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No))  
* tenure (Number of months the customer has stayed with the company)  
* PhoneService (Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No))  
* MultipleLines (Whether the customer has multiple lines r not (Yes, No, No phone service)  
                 * InternetService (Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)  
                                    * OnlineSecurity (Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service)

It can be noted that almost all of the methods give nearly the same amount of confidence limit.

Some of them may hardly give any information to the model. To reduce the curse of dimentionality, we may remove the variables that are not relevant from the analysis. For this purpose we are looking for the confidence limit of difference between two probabilities.

A contigency table is constructed for the variables gender and churn.

Root of $Z_0=\sqrt{0.083922}=0.289693$. Since $-1.645<0.289693<1.645$ we failed to reject $H_0$ when $\alpha=0.1$. Also the wald confidence interval at 90% confidence level (-0.02091671 < 0 < 0.01465185) include zero. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the probability of female getting churned is different than probability of male getting churned. So we remove the variable from the analysis.

A contigency table is constructed for the variables PhoneService and churn.

Since this interval include zero, there is no sufficient evidence to indicate the difference in the proportions of churned customers using phone service and churned customers who are not using phone service. Since both the confidence intervals failed to prove any difference in the proportion of both types of customers, we will proceed with the hypothesis test with 90 % confidence limit to determine whether to include this variable in the regression model. The hypothesis is given below:

Root of $Z_0=\sqrt{2.5492}=1.596621$. Since $-1.645<1.596621<1.645$ we failed to reject $H_0$ when $\alpha=0.1$. Eventhough the wald confidence interval at 90% confidence level (0.0009009569 < w < 0.0578842902) does not include zero, its lower limit is almost equal to zero even at 90% confidence limit. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the probability of customers with phone service getting churned is different than probability of customers without phone service getting churned. So we remove the variable from the analysis.

If we take the case of Senior citizens, we can calculate how large is the odds of a senior citizen getting churned compared non-senior citizen. For that purpose we have to create a contingency table including variables 'SeniorCitizens' and 'churn'.

Most of these variables seems to have rebundant information as atleast one of their levels depends on the some other levels of a different variable. For that purpose we need to create a multinomial contigency table as shown below for the variables `PhoneService` and `MultipleLines`.

We have to again create the contingency table for these binary variables to test the hypothesis on difference in probabilities. By this way we can determine if these variable explains the variation in the churn behaviour.

We failed to reject $H_0$ when $\alpha=0.05$. The wald confidence interval at 95% confidence level include zero. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the probability of probabilities of these variables are different. So we remove the variable from the analysis.

This means that we failed to reject null hypothesis that there is no difference between the probabilities. So this variable `Partner` is explaining some of the variability in the variable `Dependents`. This means that the variables may be giving rebundant information.

The function stepAIC from the mass package is used for variable selection. It is an iterative process  in which variables are added and removed, in order to get a subset of variables that gives the best performing model.

After various trial and error methods, the following model is considered as the final model for the evaluation. Trying to remove the variable `MonthlyCharges` also increased the significance of many other variables. But when this is used as an interaction term in the model, model is performing much better. Interaction is found between variables `MultipleLines` and `MonthlyCharges`. It makes sense as more the number of lines a customer is having more will be his monthly charges. The model is defined below.

The rario of deviance and the degree of freedom is used to measure the goodness of the fit for the model, which is given as `r ddf`. To check if this is too far from 1 for the model created, we check this using the threshold values, `r c(thresh2, thresh3)`. Since `r ddf`<`r thresh2` and also `r ddf`<`r thresh3` the model is a good fit.

Some variables were rebundant and were leaking duplicate information in to the model. Such variables were identified and removed. Variables like InternetService and PhoneService were already included in many other variables. Also it was found that some binary variables like PhoneService and Gender were not able to explain the variance in the response variable. Such variables were identified and removed. The variable SeniorCitizen was having the maximum effect on the response variable. It was able explain much of the variance in the response variable. Contigency tables were constructed for analysis of independence. Some multinomial variable were found to be independ of the response variable. The model was build using the most important identified variables. After many trial and error iterations, we came up with the final variable that also included an interaction term between multiple lines and monthly charges.  It makes sense as more the number of lines a customer is having more will be his monthly charges. The  model was evaluated using the goodness of the fit test. The deviance of the model was found to be `r rdev` and the ratio between the deviation and the degree of freedom was close to one, which proved that the model is well fitting the data. The prediction results showed that the model performance was satisfactory. 82.3 % of the variablity in the response variable was explained by the model. The sensitivity of the model was also very high reaching 82.32%.

The other issues identified included lack of independece, rebundant information and high correlation between some calculated fields. The model was build using the variables that were identified to be relevant for explaining the variance in the response variable. Various statistical techniques including cinfidence intervals, hypothesis analysis, tests for independence, Odds ratio were used at multi times in the analysis to get the best model. The model was satisfactory in predicting the churned and non churned customer in test dataset.
